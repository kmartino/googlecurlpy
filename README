== googlecurlpy.py

This simple script exercises the Google Reader API to add a feed to your subscription list with a label and a tag.  The script exercises a few APIs along the way, just as an example to learn from.  

The script uses cURL for communication with the API so that API calls can easily be observed, shared, and called independently of the script.  This makes debugging API useage with a team easier.  Most computers come with cURL installed and for those that don't you can easily do so.

Essentially this Python script acts as a cURL wrapper, enabling the parsing of responses so that variables can be captured and sent to subsequent responses.

== Getting Started

1. Install cURL binaries and add it to your PATH:

http://curl.haxx.se/

2. python googlecurlpy.py

Enjoy!

== Future Direction

Test cases and an actual GUI could be easily added to the script.
